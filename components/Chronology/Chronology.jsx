      <p>In 2013, I began my apprenticeship in butchery alongside my father and mother in a small family business, where I worked for 3 years.
          During that time, I acquired a range of basic skills such as deboning, working with dangerous machinery, and maintaining order.

          Subsequently, I worked at a large butcher shop known in my region as "Carnicería El Cali," where I was employed for three years.
          During that period, I honed the teachings of my father, gaining more speed in my work, improving my ability to work as part of a team, and developing skills to train new employees.

          Currently, I work at Carnicería Matamoros, a family business where I was given the position of professional butcher.
          Here, I am responsible for controlling raw materials, making cuts, and providing customer service.

          One never stops learning, and over the years, I have realized that there are great talents in the world of butchery.
